If you have never used [makeappicon.com](http://makeappicon.com/) to generate all icons for your iOS Apps you are missing out!
Well, were missing out, this module aims to enhance the experience of the site plus allow give you a drag
and drop ready icon set!

## Requirements

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- You need `gm/covert` binaries in your `$PATH` as [explained here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17756587/installing-graphicsmagick-on-mac-os-x-10-8). On MacOS, run the following:

```bash
brew uninstall imagemagick graphicsmagick libpng jpeg
brew cleanup -s
brew install graphicsmagick
```

## Usage:

Fire up a terminal and type:

```bash
npm install -g makeappicon
```

Create a 1024x1024 png image and call the script as such:

```bash
makeappicon --base-icon pathToBaseIcon.png
```

That takes the icon file and generates all the images that you need into the `AppIcon.appiconset`
directory. Open XCode, open your `Images.xcassets` pane and delete the default AppIcon entry, now drag and
drop the entire `AppIcon.appiconset` directory into that pane and you should be good to go! Build your app
and you should see your new icon all over the place.

## Troubleshooting

### gm/convert binaries can't be found
